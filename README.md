## In this project, we will develop a Document Summarization application leveraging an Advanced RAG pipeline, using embedding models, Large Language Models (LLMs), post-processing techniques, and re-ranking models.
### We need following tools needs to be setup to run this example
#### We are going to setup ollama for running LLM model and embedding model. and for vector store we will be using Qdrant cloud setup.  
### Step1: Get the better understanding of the RAG 
  
### step2:
